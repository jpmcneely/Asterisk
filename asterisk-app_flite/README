           Flite For Asterisk
===========================================

This provides the "Flite" dialplan application, which allows you to use
the Flite TTS Engine with Asterisk. This module invokes the Flite TTS engine
locally, and uses it to render text to speech.
It works with asterisk versions 1.6.x, 1.8, 10

------------
Requirements
------------
Asterisk 1.6.1 (or later) header files
Flite 1.4 (or later) libraries and header files

------------
Installation
------------
$ make
$ make install

To install the sample configuration file, issue the following command after
the 'make install' command:

$ make samples

-----
Usage
-----
Flite(text[,intkeys]) This will invoke the Flite TTS engine, send a text string,
get back the resulting waveform and play it to the user, allowing any given
interrupt keys to immediately terminate and return the value, or 'any' to
allow any number back.

--------
Examples
--------
dialplan sample code for your extensions.conf
