# Sound file conversion

sox yourfile.wav -r 8000 -c 1 yourfile.gsm

# If sox is used, it has been recommended that you lower the volume a
# bit and keep the file in wave format for improved quality. For our
# samples, 50% sounded just right:

sox inputfile.wav -r 8000 -s -c 1 -v 0.5 -w outputfile.wav resample -ql

# Once the file is converted copy the file to the 
# /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/custom folder and use it in your dialplan.
